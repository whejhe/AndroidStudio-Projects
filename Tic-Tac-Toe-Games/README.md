Assalamu Alaikum (Ø§Ù„Ø³Ù„Ø§Ù… Ø¹Ù„ÙŠÙƒÙ…). This is an android-based gaming project. There are two parts to this project. One is UI and the other is Back-End part. In it, I have used XML for the UI design and JAVA for the Back-End part smoothly for a better experience of the games. As It's an open source project.
